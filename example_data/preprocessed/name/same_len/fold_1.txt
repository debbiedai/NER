Our O

two O

The O

class O
consists O
of O
homozygous O

( O

that O

( O

. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
second O
class O
consists O
of O
alleles O
that O
are O
recessive O
lethal O
and O
do O
not O
exhibit O
lethality O
in O
combination O
with O
mutations O
in O

The O
alleles O
in O
this O
second O
class O
are O
clearly O
loss-of-function O
( O
LOF O
) O
with O
both O
complete O
and O
partial O
loss-of-function O
mutations O
represented O
. O

We O
find O
that O
one O
allele O
in O
the O

class O
of O
recessive O
lethals O
exhibits O
dominant-negative O
behavior O
, O
albeit O
distinct O
from O
the O

activity O
of O
the O
first O
class O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
first O
class O
of O
viable O
alleles O
can O
be O
reverted O
to O
lethality O
and O
on O
our O
ability O
to O
independently O
generate O
recessive O
lethal O
sax B
mutations O
, O
our O
analysis O
demonstrates O
that O
sax B
is O
an O
essential O
gene O
. O

Consistent O
with O
this O
conclusion O
, O
we O
find O
that O
a O
normal O
sax B
transcript O
is O
produced O
by O
saxP B
, O
a O
viable O

previously O
reported O
to O
be O
null O
, O
and O
that O
this O
allele O
can O
be O

to O
lethality O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
determine O
that O
two O
mutations O
in O
the O
first O
class O
of O
sax O
alleles O
show O
the O

amino O
